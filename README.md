# pyRDDLGym-prost
This repository contains the docker files for connecting the Monte-Carlo Tree Search planner [PROST](https://github.com/prost-planner/prost) with pyRDDLGym.

> [!NOTE]  
> PROST only works with finite state and action domains only.
> If you wish to do planning for continuous state and/or action spaces, check out the [gradient-based JAX planner](https://github.com/pyrddlgym-project/pyRDDLGym-jax) or the [deep reinforcement learning wrappers](https://github.com/pyrddlgym-project/pyRDDLGym-rl).
